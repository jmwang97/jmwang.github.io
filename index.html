    <h1>Segway</h1>
    <p>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!</p>
    <h3>August 20, 2012 </h3>
    <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
    <ul>
     	<li>Walla Walla,WA</li>
     	<li>Magic City, ID</li>
     	<li>Bountiful, UT</li>
     	<li>Last Chance, CO</li>
     	<li>Why, AZ </li>
     	<li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
     </ul> 
    </p>
    <h3>July 14, 2012 </h3>
    <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
        <blockquote>
        <em>
        Passing cars, 
        <br>When you can't see, </br>
        May get you,
        <br>A glimpse,</br> 
        Of eternity.
        </em>
        </blockquote>
        I definitely won't be passing any cars.
    </p>
    <h3>June 2, 2012</h3>
    <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
    <ol>
    	<li>cell phone</li>
    	<li>iPod</li>
    	<li>digital camera</li>
    	<li>a protein bar</li>
    </ol>
    Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said,
        <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
